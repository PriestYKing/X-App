# X-App

A full-stack application consisting of a backend and frontend.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for the X-App project.  
It is divided into two main parts:
- **x-backend:** The backend server application (Rust-based).
- **x-frontend:** The frontend client application (Next.js/TypeScript).

## Features

- Scalable backend powered by Rust.
- Modern frontend using Next.js and TypeScript.
- Clear modular folder structure for separation of concerns.
